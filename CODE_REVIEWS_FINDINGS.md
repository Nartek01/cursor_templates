## Example Milestone (Reference)

This example shows how to apply the template in practice.

### Milestone 1: Component Control System ‚úÖ

#### Files Reviewed
- `components/control-panel/index.js`
- `components/control-panel/control.js`
- `components/control-panel/utils.js`
- `styles/control-panel.scss`

#### ‚úÖ Passing Criteria

1. **Naming Conventions** - PASS
   - Consistent use of `control-*` pattern
   - Clear function and variable names

2. **Pure Functions** - PASS
   - `utils.js` exports only pure data
   - No side effects detected

3. **Memoization** - PASS
   - `useMemo` correctly used for expensive operations
   - Proper dependency arrays

4. **Framework Integration** - PASS
   - Follows React best practices
   - Proper component composition

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

##### üî¥ CRITICAL

1. **Missing Value Synchronization** - `control.js`
   - **Line:** 25-30
   - **Issue:** Control doesn't show current selected value
   - **Impact:** User can't see current state after page reload
   - **Fix:** Add `value` prop derived from current state

##### üü° MODERATE

2. **Inline Styles Anti-pattern** - `control.js`
   - **Line:** 52
   - **Issue:** `style={{ border: '1px solid #949494' }}` should be in stylesheet
   - **Recommendation:** Extract to CSS class for maintainability

3. **Missing Documentation** - `utils.js`
   - **Lines:** All functions
   - **Issue:** No JSDoc comments explaining purpose
   - **Recommendation:** Add function documentation

##### üü¢ MINOR

4. **Unnecessary Fragment** - `index.js`
   - **Line:** 17-19
   - **Issue:** Fragment wrapping single element
   - **Fix:** Return element directly
