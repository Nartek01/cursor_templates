## Example Milestone (Reference)

This example shows how to apply the template in practice.

### Milestone 1: Main Navigation Component ‚úÖ

#### Files Reviewed
- `components/navigation/header-nav.php`
- `components/navigation/nav-menu.js`
- `styles/navigation.scss`

#### ‚úÖ Passing Criteria

1. **WCAG Level A** - PASS
   - Keyboard accessible
   - Proper HTML structure
   - Correct ARIA implementation

2. **Semantic HTML** - PASS
   - Uses `<nav>` landmark
   - Proper `<ul>` list structure
   - Semantic button elements

3. **Keyboard Navigation** - PASS
   - Full keyboard access
   - Visible focus indicators
   - No keyboard traps

4. **Screen Reader** - FAIL (see issue #1)
   - Navigation announced correctly
   - But submenu state not communicated

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

##### üî¥ CRITICAL

1. **Missing aria-expanded on Submenu Toggles** - `nav-menu.js`
   - **Line:** 42-48
   - **WCAG Criterion:** 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
   - **Issue:** Dropdown toggle buttons don't communicate expanded/collapsed state to screen readers
   - **User Impact:** Screen reader users can't tell if submenu is open or closed
   - **Fix:** Add `aria-expanded="false"` initially, toggle to `true` when opened:
   ```javascript
   button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', isOpen ? 'true' : 'false');
   ```
   - **Testing:** Use NVDA/JAWS, verify "expanded" or "collapsed" announced with button

##### üü° MODERATE

2. **Inconsistent Focus Indicator** - `navigation.scss`
   - **Line:** 89-92
   - **Standard:** WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
   - **Issue:** Focus outline has only 2:1 contrast ratio on dark backgrounds
   - **User Impact:** Low vision users may not see keyboard focus location
   - **Recommendation:** Increase contrast to 3:1 minimum, use outline + box-shadow for visibility:
   ```scss
   &:focus {
     outline: 2px solid #fff;
     outline-offset: 2px;
     box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
   }
   ```

3. **Generic Link Text in Mobile Menu** - `header-nav.php`
   - **Lines:** 125, 138, 142
   - **Standard:** WCAG 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A) - Best Practice
   - **Issue:** Several links say "Learn more" without context
   - **User Impact:** Screen reader users navigating by links can't distinguish destinations
   - **Recommendation:** Add visually-hidden text or use aria-label:
   ```php
   <a href="/about">Learn more<span class="sr-only"> about our mission</span></a>
   ```

##### üü¢ MINOR

4. **Missing Skip Link** - `header-nav.php`
   - **Line:** Top of file
   - **Issue:** No skip navigation link to main content
   - **Enhancement:** Add skip link as first focusable element:
   ```html
   <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
   ```

- Creates significant difficulty but not complete barrier
- Best practices not followed
- Inconsistent accessibility patterns
- Examples: Poor contrast, vague link text, missing skip links, inconsistent focus

**Assign MINOR (üü¢) when:**
- WCAG Level AAA considerations
- Enhancement opportunities beyond compliance
- Very low impact on users
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Examples: Could improve contrast beyond minimum, minor semantic improvements

### Testing Frequency Recommendations

- **Initial Development:** Review each component as built
- **Pre-Launch:** Complete audit of all pages/features
